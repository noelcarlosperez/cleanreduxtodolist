# Clean Redux Todo List

Clean Redux Todo List is my aproach to create an architecture that could address some iOS architectural problems, like Massive View Controllers,
Massive Storyboards with a lot of segues, dealing with data that may come from multiple sources(API calls, the user interaction with the App, 
sensors) using what the Swift Community and I during years dealing with this issues have found that works.
